This project undertakes a thorough analysis of the impact of Energy Consumption and, 
to a lesser extent, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on CO2 emissions. By meticulously examining 
data and employing visualization techniques, it uncovers several key insights:

1- Temporal Trends: The analysis spans from 1965 to 2021, revealing temporal trends in energy consumption, 
GDP, and their correlation with CO2 emissions over time.

2- Global Energy Consumption and GDP: Insightful findings emerge regarding global energy consumption patterns 
and GDP trends, shedding light on their influence on carbon dioxide emissions.

3- Impact of Energy Sources: The project delves into identifying the most significant and least impactful energy 
sources in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, providing valuable insights for environmental policymaking and resource allocation.

4- Geographic Analysis: By examining global geographic patterns of energy consumption, the project offers a comprehensive 
understanding of regional disparities and their implications for environmental sustainability.


Through meticulous data examination and visualization, this project aims to deepen our understanding of 
the intricate relationship between energy consumption, GDP, and CO2 emissions, offering valuable insights 
for informed decision-making and policy formulation in the realm of environmental sustainability.
